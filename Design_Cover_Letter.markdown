 To Whom It May Concern:

I am interested in a career as a serial entrepreneur. In fact, I have
already started my first company this year focusing on a niche dental
product. However, I have always been passionate about design, and my
experience in entrepreneurship has taught me first hand the importance
of design in building a company. From design of the product to branding
of the company itself, design is crucial to corporate success. I am
looking for an internship or starting position in a design firm that
will allow me to enhance my design skills and learn from the best in the
industry.

I am currently a dual master’s student in bioengineering and mechanical
engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. I believe this analytical
background and my comfort with problem solving is an asset in any
position. However, I am more than an engineer. I am creative, motivated,
and design oriented as.

Since I began my Masters program in September of 2012 I have focused
largely on robotics and product design. This opportunity marries these
two interests perfectly. I also have experience with various
manufacturing techniques, control systems, and simulation design, which
further qualify me for this position.

I believe I contribute more than mere technical expertise though. The
job description describes the ideal candidate as a hands-on, creative
team player who is comfortable taking risks and is flexible enough to
work in a rapidly changing environment. I believe I embody the creative
risk taker. I have started two different technology-related businesses
in the last two years. And few work environments are more quickly
changing than that of a start-up. I have been involved in every aspect
of product development, from basic science, to product safety, to
packaging, and thoroughly enjoy working with cross-functional teams. I
am also hands-on. I love prototyping my ideas and bringing my imaginings
into reality. This is evidenced by my various mechatronic projects both
in and out of class.

I look forward to contributing as a member of the iPhone/iPod product
design team and am excited by the prospect of “developing cutting edge
product” the likes of which have never been built before.

Thanks so much.

Sincerely,

Raffi Holzer
